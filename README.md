# Bolt Blog

## Introduction

This is a simple blog I created while learning React following [Net Ninja's React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d).

It features a blog archive, viewing single blogs, deleting blogs, and creating new blogs. There is no user authentication at this time.

## Local Setup

To start local setup, do the following.

1. Run `npm install`
2. Start the back-end server via `npx json-server --watch data/db.json`
3. Start the front-end server using SWC and Vite with `npm run dev`
4. Voila! You should now have the site running and visible for browsing!
